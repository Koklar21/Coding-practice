# Coding Practice & AI Practice

This repo is my public sandbox for learning, experimenting, and practicing code.
I’m focusing on small 10–15 minute lessons in Python, FastAPI, and AI-related topics.  
Nothing here is polished — it’s all about progress, not perfection.

## Structure
Each folder = one practice session:
- **day01_pydantic_fastapi/** → First FastAPI endpoint with Pydantic validation
- **day02_query_params/** → GET endpoint with query params
- **day03_sqlite_intro/** → Intro to SQLite database connection
- ...and so on

## Purpose
- Keep myself consistent with coding drills.
- Track my learning over time.
- Share progress openly (anyone’s welcome to peek).
